# CRISP-DM Template Documents

[Project research](project_research.md) covers the initial research phase, including all business understanding to support the project plan. The [project plan](project_plan.md) formalises the project research into a document that can be referenced and internally and by the customer regarding project focus and deliverables.

At this point you'll be able to collect, describe, explore, and format your data, which should all be described in the [data report](data_report.md).

The [model report](model_report.md) describes the modelling runs performed, their assessment, and the final evaluation of the model(s) put forward for potential deployment.

It's at this stage the [quality assurance report](qa_report.md) is created to understand how the data mining process has been implented, what went well, etc., and if anything has been missed that could effect deployment.

The [deployment plan](deployment_plan.md) details this deployment, i.e. the strategy, monitoring and maintenance.

At this stage, a final report/presentation or potentially series of reports/presentations - dependent on the target group(s) needed to be created to report the results of the data mining project.

After this, the [exit report](exit_report.md) should be created to understand the whole project (e.g. what went well/bad, tips for future projects, etc.). This concludes the project - or phase - after completion.
