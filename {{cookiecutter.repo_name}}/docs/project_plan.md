# Project Plan: {{cookiecutter.project_name}}

## Abstract

This document lists the stages to be executed in the project, together with their duration, resources required, inputs, outputs, and dependencies. Wherever possible, large-scale iterations (e.g. modelling and evaluation) are made explicit, and dependencies between time scheduling and risks are analysed. Alongside the core plan, risks and contingency plans are defined with action recommendations should any risk manifest itself.

This document should be referenced/reviewed continually through the project, and should be consulted whenever a new task - including further iterations - is begun.
