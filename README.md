# Project boilerplate

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

Project boilerplate I currently use for early-phase projects (as of 2023-07-29).

# Background

> Description to be added.

## Install

This template has been tested to work with `python==3.10.12` and `cookiecutter==2.2.3`.

## Usage

Open your CLI and run:

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/mwtmurphy/project-boilerplate
```

You are then prompted for information on the project. After completing these questions, a directory will be created with boilerplate code and docs for you to use.
